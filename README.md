# CurseMeta Ultraslim edition (2019)

A bridge between the MultiMC (and others) and CurseForge/Twitch's internal API.

This effort comes from a dark time in 2017 when the API required binary encoded SOAP bullshit and autentication.
It's been unauthenticated REST since roughly April 2019, making this app a lot simpler.

Along the way many ideals have fallen, untill this was all that's left.

I host this on my NAS at home because my server's IP got blacklisted in September 2019.
I hope to move it back to a more sane enviroment once the issue gets resolved (in progress as of October).

Current (2019-10) average usage: 11 million request per month, about half of which are cached by CloudFlare. That's about 15k per hour.
